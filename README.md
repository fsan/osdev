# OSDEV tutorials

Following up documents and references: https://wiki.osdev.org/Tutorials

Although osdev intention is to not share details in a straigh forward way as it expects any material to be used by seasoned programmers that will lookup for details, I would like to provide extra information on that material while I study myself.
I also believe that not sharing the knowledge in a straightforward way was a valid concept in the past where people needed to learn how to learn.
As older generations are now retiring, we are loosing the experience accumulated by them and shared freely in the past.
Learning to learn is still the best way but gradually old references are being lost.
It also costs me nothing to share the bits I learn with others.
