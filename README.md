# OSDEV tutorials

Following up documents and references: https://wiki.osdev.org/Tutorials

Wiki.Osdev does not share many details and explanations intentionally during tutorials.
It is up to the reader to take the challenge and learn more about what is going on until the desired level.
This repository contains some of my notes and reference materials used while I studied each topic.

Note: part of the text for the explanations was (partially) generated automatically. I did review the output text but there might be problems here and there.
